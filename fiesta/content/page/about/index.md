My name is Andrew Baughman. Whenever I introduce myself, I try to keep it to specifically that. People usually end up choosing to call me either Andrew or "Boffman" or sometimes a mix of both. I like either one, though "Boffman" is pretty fun if it comes from the right people. 

One time in high school, I thought it would it be cool if people started calling my Ty, short for my middle name. It was not, and no one did. Since then, I let people call me whatever they end up calling me. As long as it's not insulting or otherwise distasteful, I allow it. 

Speaking of the name "Boffman", here's a story. I had cash to burn once, and I got a vanity plate that reads "BOFMAN". I wanted both "f"s, but I had to get a picture of a spaceship on the plate, so only 6 characters. This does bring a smile to my face.
