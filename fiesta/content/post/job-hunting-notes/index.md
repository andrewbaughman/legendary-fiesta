I recently started a new job. Here are the notes I developed as I was going through the job hunting process.

This is just what I’ve learned, so judge it all for yourself.

**Your attitude determines your altitude.**

## Mindset

Mindset is the most important thing when looking for a job.

- Don’t live in fear. You are valued by God, so live in trust. 
- Don’t wait for escape to paradise. Work on making paradise where you are now.
- Friends are on of your greatest assets. Tell them stuff. 
- The more you know yourself, the more likely you’ll be able to make choices that put you where you want to be with you who want to be with doing what you want to do.
- Don’t miss opportunities when they present themselves. Leap on them, but only if you trust them.

## Search Notes

Here is a summary of the notes I used for my search.

- Be Prepared.
- Positivity is ideal. Humility and honesty are great also.
- Keep a list of companies you’re specially interested in.
- Know what you’re looking for. Define it clearly.
- Work on your resume, have someone review it.
    - Don’t feel bad about putting a small innocuous funny on your resume. I accidentally did this and got asked about it in my interview.
- Write a note answering questions you might be asked. Revise as needed.
- Write a note of questions to ask at the interview, or at all interviews. Probably ask between 2 and 3 questions. I once asked like 5 or 6 questions and it sucked.
- Learn what Agile is. Learn what REST is, learn what APIs are. Vagueness is your enemy. Be unsatisfied with vague analogous answers. This might be a more personal thing, but I don’t like buzzwords. Buzzwords can be helpful to know (only if you know what they mean), but they are also stupid and mean nothing. Just describe what it is. Use your words. It’s why you learned English.
- It hasn’t come in handy recently, but sometimes it’s good to distinguish yourself from other people by emailing or calling the company directly. 

## Interviews

- People love their names. Remember their names. Write their names. Say their names. Chat with the receptionist. 
- Be honest. If you act like someone else at the interview and they hire you, they’ll have hired someone else. Then you’ll be imprisoned in someone else’s life and you or them will hate it.
- Dress better than you think you need to. They expect you to dress that way, so if you dress like they’re dressed, they’ll think you usually look like crap.


## Interview Questions

Technical questions will be asked, but there’s no telling what they’ll be. I never review technical things before an interview. If I don’t know it at work, I won’t know it for the interview. 

Personal questions, like “give an example of a difficult problem?” are what you want to prepare for. That question in particular I’ve only been able to answer just recently, and I’ve been thinking about it for years. As much as you can, try to answer questions with specific examples. Try not to talk for very long, but be clear and give context. 

With questions I ask them, I’m more concerned with knowing if I’d like working with the people and if I’d trust the company with my future than what the actual work is. I’m not picky about what kind of software I’m working on.

### Sample Questions to Answer (you need to have an answer you believe):
* Why do I do it?
* What do you work on at CE?
* What is the project you’re most proud of?
* Greatest Strength?
* Greatest Weakness?
* Tell us about yourself
* What’s something that irritates you?
* What’s an example of a difficult problem you’ve encountered?
* What’s an example of a time when you disagreed with employee
* Give me an example of how you set goals.
* Tell me about a time when you had to be creative to solve a problem.
* Tell me about a time you made a mistake.
* How would your friends describe you?
* What kind of work are you interested in doing?
* Do you prefer to work on your own or in a team?
* Tell me about a time that you had to deal with a tricky bug. How did you fix it? What was the outcome?

### Sample Questions to Ask (ask 2-3, ideally not all at once):
* How often do projects change?
* What does mentorship look like?
* How do you relate the company’s goals to people in this position?
* What are you looking for in an ideal candidate?
* Does your team often challenge each other to improve?
* How do you get support from management?
* Ask for clarification on what you’ll be doing.
* Are there learning opportunities within the company?
* Will I be working in a team?
* What is the culture like?


## Books I’ve found very helpful with a few notes:

Reading is the best way to keep your mind growing. Read things that apply to your life, things that challenge you, things that help you.

* [The Ideal Team Player](https://web.archive.org/web/20220720155617/https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28930640-the-ideal-team-player)
    - Humble (talk to people below you, the receptionist, the janitor)
    - Hungry (seek to do better than you did yesterday)
    - Smart (street smarts, not IQ)

* [Clean Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20220720172816/https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code)
    - Words mean things. Ambiguity is your enemy.
    - Good code is readable code.
* [The Compound Effect](https://web.archive.org/web/20220720172844/https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/9420697-the-compound-effect)
    - Your attitude determines your altitude.
    - Appreciation is far more valuable than criticism.
    - Avoid thinking about negative things as much as you can. Find ways to spin things into positives.
    - Winning is a habit. So is losing. Habits can be made and broken with much effort, but all it requires is a continuous decision.
