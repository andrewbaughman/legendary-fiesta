## Intro

**Will we cherish Lady Wisdom, or will we be seduced to stay at Hotel California?**

The lyrics to the song Hotel California were written by Don Henley and Glenn Frey, neither of whom were biblical scholars nor were they known for studying the Bible privately. I don't think the lyrics of Hotel California were designed to accurately represent biblical ideas. But regardless of the writers' intentions, biblical ideas are present. Again let me be clear, this post isn't about the writers' intentions, it's about connections I've made to the Bible.

And just to get ahead a little, I interpret the singer in the song to represent us, the listeners. 

The biblical ideas I'll be digging into are the following:
- the seductive power of folly
- the vanity of extravagance and hedonism
- the entrapment of wickedness
- the lure to death

## Seduction

The first stanza and chorus in Hotel California show the singer finding a place to stay. He comes across a hotel and notes 4 things. 
- a woman standing in the doorway
- a call to action ("I heard the mission bell")
- the place is either Heaven or Hell (probably in a metaphorical sense)
- there were voices emanating from the place calling it lovely and welcoming

Considering he mentions the woman in the doorway and hearing a mission bell, I'll have to assume he means he found the woman quite attractive. As for the hotel, he is uncertain as to it's true nature, but he knows it is either very good or very bad. The hotel itself speaks to him welcomingly as if to convince him it is Heaven, not Hell.

In the early chapters of the book of Proverbs (1-9), the narrator is a father instructing his son to pursue wisdom and avoid wickedness, which he also calls folly. At times, wisdom and folly are characterized as two women named Wisdom and Folly. 

In Proverbs 7, a story is told of a man being seduced by "the adulterous woman" he is being told Wisdom will keep him from. From the description of her in this passage, we are told she is crafty and bold, seeking to lure the young man during the night. She tells the young man she has acquired wealth from her recent marriage and that she is prepared to be with him. The father tells his son "With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk."

In Proverbs 9, Folly is said to sit at the door of her house, calling out to those who pass by, "Let all who are simple come to my house!"

Hotel California also features a woman at the door of a hotel. She leads the man into the hotel while the hotel itself welcomes him and charms him. Just like in Proverbs, this lady who leads him into the hotel is alluring while the hotel is charming him as Folly charms the yound man in the story.

## Hedonism and Extravagance

Hotel California lays this topic on pretty thick. The narrator takes care to mention several ways in which life in the hotel is hedonistic and extravagant. 

Note: I'm thinking the woman here is the same woman who invited him into the hotel.

She is obsessed with jewelry. ("Her mind is Tiffany-twisted")
She spends liberally on a car. ("she got the Mercedes-Benz")
She hands out with a lot of men, possibly for sex. ("She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends")
They all dance, and they dance a whole lot. ("How they dance...sweet summer sweat")
Life with the hotel is rich enough for there to be a Captain ("So I called up the Captain")
They have a really good time. ("They livin' it up...")
They're likely doing things they shouldn't be doing. ("Bring your alibis")

And if you weren't convinced yet, it keeps coming.

> Mirrors on the ceiling
>
> The pink champagne on ice...

That's not the last example of extravagance, but it's enough. This is of course a set up for what comes next.

## Vanity

> And in the master's chambers
>
> They gathered for the feast
>
> They stab it with their steely knives
>
> But they just can't kill the beast

In the last stanza featuring the other hotel guests, a major point of the song comes to full revelation. The lavish life in the hotel cannot satisfy its guests. While they aggressively attack their feast, stabbing it with steely knives, they can never kill it and eat it. Proverbs makes a similar point. "Death and destruction are never satisfied, and neither are human eyes" (Proverbs 27:20). 

The book of Ecclesiastes takes more time to explore this idea. The narrator explains that he tried everything he could think of but was never satisfied. He lists the pursuits and activites at length.

While this stanza reveals vanity clearly, it is foreshadowed throughout the song. The first time of course is in the first stanza: "This could be Heaven and this could be Hell". The second is when the narrator asks the Captain for wine, to which the Captain responds, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine". The impression I get is that the narrator was expecting to find something good in the hotel, but it is not there.

After being shown the extravagance and hedonism of the hotel, we have also been shown that ultimately this life doesn't fulfill the desires it was expected to and that ravenous self indulgence never satisfies Hotel California's guests.  

## Entrapment

Toward the end of the song, the narrator comes to realize that the hotel is not merely an attraction.

![It's a Trap](its_a_trap.jpg)

Just before we're told the hotel's guests are never satified, the woman tells us "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device". So even the woman who enjoys all of these extravagances know it's a sham, yet she chooses to stay all the same. There is a popular quote of C.S. Lewis that seems to apply here, especially given the Heaven/Hell association with the hotel. From The Problem of Pain, "the doors of Hell are locked on the inside" is Lewis's way of saying the ultimate status of a person's life is determined by that person's choices and lifestyle. We're the one who lock the door.

The next stanza displays our narrator panickingly trying to escape the hotel, remarking "I had to find the passage back to the place I was before". To his surprise, he discovers by an encounter with "the night man" (likely a clerk) that people can come to the hotel, but never leave. 

I have trouble understanding this. The song has me thinking the hotel, a picture of self indulgence, is Hell, or some hellish prison. But are we prisoners of our own choice, or can we never leave? If it's by our own choice, then I would think one can simply choose to leave. I might say that perhaps we are so amused by self indulgence that at some point it is evident we'll never try to get out, but the narrator does try. He tries to find the passage back to the place he was before. 

Regardless of what this song's theology or lack there of is, the narrator has found himself realizing he must leave this life of self indulgence that doesn't satisfy, yet he finds himself unable to escape. 

This resonates with several biblical passages. Here are a few that are short and quippy, but get the point across.
- "sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you" Genesis 4:7
- "...In the work of his own hands the wicked is snared" Psalm 9:16
- "Let the wicked fall into their own nets" Psalm 141:10
- "His own iniquities will capture the wicked" Proverbs 5:22
- "...Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour." 1 Peter 5:8

I know they've have been taken out of context, but these verses underscore the idea present throughout the Bible that wickedness/Folly is a trap, like an animal intenting to eat you.

But I really like this one. Paul refers to the love of money as a craving just as Hotel California earlier shows an aggressive feast that doesn't satisfy the guests.

 > "But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs." 
 > <cite>1 Timothy 6:9-10</cite>


## Lured to Death

Now that we've covered the whole song, let's consider the way that self indulgence tricks us into pursuing it.

The narrator chooses to stay at the hotel when he is tired. He explains in the first stanza, "My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night". It's also worth noting that he is intoxicated as well. We learn that the "warm smell of colitas (marijuana)" is rising in the air. The narrator has found himself drawn to this wayward place while his vision is impaired, literally and metaphorically. He is vulnerable. 

You know the rest of the story, but there are more connections with Proverbs and lady Folly.

Proverbs 7:26-27 
> Many are the victims she has brought down;
>
> her slain are a mighty throng.
>
> Her house is a highway to the grave,
>
> leading down to the chambers of death.

Proverbs 9:16-18
> ...To those who have no sense she says,
>
> 'Stolen water is sweet;
>
> food eaten in secret is delicious!'
>
> But little do they know that the dead are there,
>
> that her guests are deep in the realm of the dead.

This lady Folly who promised pleasure, but delivers death.

Something similar happens in the Garden of Eden story when Adam and Eve are being tempted by the serpent. The serpent uses "persuasive words" and "smooth talk" on the woman so that she is convinced that "the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye". Her husband is part of this, and he eats it too. After taking the fruit they were convinced would fulfill them and make them wise, the two discover fear of each other and even hide from God. Perhaps they are trapped by their shame. 

In a moment of weakness, the two foundational human beings are deceived satisfying themselves by their own actions rather than trusting in God's provision. In the end, they are not satisfied. God ends up giving them coverings, but they cannot go back to the garden. They cannot find the passage back to the place they were before.
